                                        The Reference section of the Library houses the Library’s reference books; those that are meant to provide quick and accessible information on any particular topic. Reference books include topics that are intended to guide researchers in their studies, but not to be major sources for a paper or other projects. The reference collection contains information on a wealth of topics, but that information does not typically go into great depth. Reference books include materials such as dictionaries, encyclopedias, bibliographies, and style guides, among others.

                                        Reference books are meant to be accessible to as many people as possible, and as such, are not permitted to leave the library. The Reference section in the SVCET Library is placed on either side of the reading section to provide convenience for the readers. Reference items may be shelved in a reference collection located separately from circulation Items (Books) or Individual reference only items available for keeping.
