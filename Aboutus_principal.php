                        <p class="mb-1"><strong>Dr. S.C.V Ramanamurty Naidu :
                        </strong><br> It gives me immense pleasure in expressing my thoughts as the Principal of Sri Venkateswara College of Engineering and Technology, Etcherla, Srikakulam. Established in the year 2008, the institute in the last 10 years has blossomed into a major education center essentially due to the combined efforts of a very dedicated team of staff and students who are committed to the overall development of the institute. The institute lays special emphasis on human values and ethics, apart from academic excellence. The College is affiliated to JNTU, Kakinada, and offers UG Programs in Civil, Electrical, Mechanical, Computer Science Engineering, and Electronics & Communication Engineering and PG Programs in Thermal Engineering, Control Systems, Power Electronics, VLSI Systems Design, and Computer Science Engineering, besides the MBA course. All the courses are approved by AICTE, New Delhi, and the Government of Andhra Pradesh.</p>

                        <p class="mb-1">We are proud of our strong team of meticulously trained, dedicated, and committed faculty and staff and the most advanced teaching aids. As we strive for excellence in what we do, the Institute is constantly making endeavors to scale new heights by developing synergy between academic knowledge, technical skill sets in line with industry needs, high moral values, and sensitivity to the environment and the Nation. Through student mentoring/counseling for every 15-20 students, teachers help them in resolving academic as well as domestic problems and inspire them to achieve excellent academic careers and overall personal development.</p>

                        <p class="mb-1">All the departments are equipped with excellent laboratory facilities. The Central library has over 19,000 text/reference books in all the disciplines of Engineering. The institute possesses all the facilities for co-curricular, extracurricular, and sports activities. Besides, every department has its own student association managed exclusively by students for arranging various co-curricular events. Efreeqz-2k13, Dynamech-2k14, Dynamech-2k15, Inspirus-2k14, and Vidyut-2k14 are some of the National level technical competitions managed by students, showcasing their managerial, organizational, and technical skills. With the support of qualified, dedicated, and hardworking faculty, the institute has achieved an enviable ranking in a short span, and I have no doubt that with this pace, SVCET will march ahead of other eminent institutes in north coastal Andhra Pradesh. I welcome you to this unique family and look forward to your valuable association with us for a better tomorrow.</p>
